# Doily Creator
A doily is an ornamental mat, typically made out of paper or some kind of fabric.

For our first [Programming II](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/courses/modules/comp1206.page) coursework, we were tasked with creating a Java GUI program that allow for a user to draw doily patterns on to the GUI.
